**4/11/25**

*Three main parts left of project:*
1) front end w bootstrap
2) Saving pixel art backend
 - using JSON to store artwork
3) Adapting websocket from chatting to artwork collaberation

Possibly use Redis store our database as an alternative to a map stored locally which we are currently planning on using. 

Caiden will work on front end and share screenshots of progress with the team for review
Jingda will help Caiden, creating some of the pages from the mockup
John will work on saving pixel art as JSON files 
Conrad will adapt websocket to work with pixel art and not just chatting

Davion did not attend this meeting and someone needs to follow up with him to see what work he has done
